# Conversational AI Workflow System Guide

This guide explains how to use the conversational AI interface that breaks down user requests into automated workflows, just like Google Mariner.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The conversational workflow system allows users to:
1. **Describe** what they want to accomplish in natural language
2. **Review** the AI-generated workflow steps before execution
3. **Approve** or modify the proposed workflow
4. **Execute** the workflow automatically
5. **Monitor** progress in real-time

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### **Step 1: Natural Language Input**
Users describe their task in plain English:
- "Find all best influencers in the Tech area and read their 5 best articles posted on LinkedIn"
- "Send personalized emails to my Google Sheets contacts"
- "Analyze customer feedback and generate insights"

### **Step 2: AI Analysis & Planning**
The AI analyzes the request and breaks it down into:
- **Workflow Name**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: What the workflow accomplishes
- **Category**: Type of workflow (Social Media Research, Marketing Automation, etc.)
- **Complexity**: Low, Medium, or High
- **Steps**: 3-8 logical workflow steps with:
  - Step name and description
  - Step type (AI action, API call, data processing, user input)
  - Estimated duration
  - Dependencies between steps

### **Step 3: User Approval**
Users can:
- **Approve** the workflow as-is
- **Modify** specific steps or request changes
- **Reject** and ask for a different approach

### **Step 4: Automatic Execution**
Once approved, the system:
- Creates a workflow from the plan
- Executes it automatically
- Provides real-time progress updates
- Shows results and completion status
